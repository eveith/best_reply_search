# Generalized Best Reply Search (BRS+) for Ruby

## Synopsis

    require 'best_reply_search'

## Description

This Ruby gem implements an algorithm that calculates the best possible move
in a multiplayer game. The algorithm is a variant of _Best Reply Search_ (BRS)
called _Generalized Best Reply Search_ (BRS+).

The implementation is based on two papers:

1. [Schadd, M. P., & Winands, M. H. (2011). Best Reply Search for multiplayer games.
